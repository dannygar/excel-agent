 This file is needed because JavaScript files can't be directly loaded into the type of runtime that Office 
 uses for Copilot API plugins. Instead, an HTML file with a <script> element loads the JavaScript.

 - Since the file's only purpose is to load other files, the <body> element is empty. The file has no UI and is never displayed to users.
 - It loads the file office.js, which is the Office JavaScript Library, from a Microsoft server.
 - It doesn't have a <script> element to load a commands.js file (transpiled from the commands.ts that you created) because this <script> element is added at build-time by another file.
 - When project is built and served on a server, the URL of this HTML file matches the value of the extensions.runtimes.code.page property in the manifest.
